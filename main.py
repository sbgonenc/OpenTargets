## This script calls parsing methods, combines data, analyses

## output --> drug modelities (drugType from molecule) distribution on subcellular locations (subcellularLocations key from Targets)

## 1. Inspect and describe the starting datasets.
## 2. Prepare the relevant data by integrating the provided datasets to effectively link drug
## modalities to the subcellular locations of their targets.
## 3. Explore and identify any significant differences in the distribution of drug modalities
## across various subcellular locations.
## 4. Enhance the analysis with visualisations that illustrate your results.
